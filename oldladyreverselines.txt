She swallowed the bird to catch the spider, 
How absurd to swallow a bird. 
There was an old lady who swallowed a bird; 
I don't know why she swallowed a fly Perhaps she'll die! 
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly; 
That wriggled and wiggled and tiggled inside her; 
There was an old lady who swallowed a spider,
